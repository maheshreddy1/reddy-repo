Q) comm: This command is used to compare two sorted files.

Syntax: comm [options] file1 file2
One set of options allows selection of ‘columns’ to suppress.
-1: suppress lines unique to file1 (column 1)
-2: suppress lines unique to file2 (column 2)
-3: suppress lines common to file1 and file2 (column3)
Example: Only show column-3 that contains lines common between file1 and file2

$ comm -12 file1 file2
